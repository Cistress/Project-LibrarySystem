# About my first project on GitHub
First, run the interface to call the function. If you are a new user, click on "registration" to create your own unique ID by typing in your username. Once the ID is created, you can then start using to borrow/return books. 

ID will be stored in user_id.csv 

On the backend, the borrowing_record will keep track of books borrowed/returned by appending/dropping lines if the user types in a valid ID, otherwise the system will send an error message.
